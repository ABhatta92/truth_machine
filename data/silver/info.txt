Here we will do the bulk of the transformations.
- Selecting, renaming and type casting columns
- Removing nulls
- Any other required transformations (where clauses, for example)
Much of these other transformations, if required, will be specific to the particular attribute we're dealing with.
For example, if we want to create age brackets from an age attribute then that will happen between bronze and silver.
